        <h1>All other things being equal: why is this so?</h2><hr>
        <p>
            When you are working with data, you will often hear the expression "all other things being equal".
            This expression is used to say that you are looking at the effect of one variable on another, while
            keeping all other variables constant. For example, if you want to know the effect of age on the
            probability of having cancer, you will want to keep all other variables constant. This is because
            if you don't, you will not be able to know if the effect you are seeing is due to age or to another
            variable.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, if you don't keep all other variables constant, you might see that the
            probability of having cancer increases with age. But this might be because older people are more
            likely to smoke, and smoking is a risk factor for cancer.
        </p>

        <h2>TLDR</h2><hr>
        <p>
            This post focus on the "all other things being equal" expression in the context of linear regression.
            We will go over the following points:
            <ul>
                <li>What is the "all other things being equal" expression?</li>
                <li>Impact on interpretation of the coefficients</li>
                <li>Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br><h3>What is the "all other things being equal" expression?</h3>
        <p>
            The "all other things being equal" expression is used to say that you are looking at the effect of one
            variable on another, while keeping all other variables constant. For example, if you want to know the
            effect of age on the probability of having cancer, you will want to keep all other variables constant.
            This is because if you don't, you will not be able to know if the effect you are seeing is due to age
            or to another variable.
        </p>
        <br><h3>Impact on interpretation of the coefficients</h3>
        <p>
            Once you have run a regression, you have a model that looks like this:
            $$\hat y = \hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 x_1 + \hat\beta_2 x_2 + \hat\beta_3 x_3$$
            where \(\hat y\) is the predicted value \(x_i\) is the value of the \(i\)-th variable and \(\hat\beta_i\) is
            the estimated coefficient of the \(i\)-th variable. The interpretation of the coefficients is the
            following: if you increase \(x_i\) by 1, then \(\hat y\) will increase by \(\hat\beta_i\), all other
            things being equal. This interpretation is based on the assumption that all other variables are constant.
        </p>
        <br><h3>Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem</h3>
        <p>
            The Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem is a theorem that allows you to get the same results as if you had
            run a regression with all the variables, while only running a regression with one variable. More formally,
            it says that if you want to know the effect of \(x_1\) on \(y\), while keeping \(x_2\) and \(x_3\) constant,
            you can run the following two regressions:
            $$\hat y = \hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 x_1 + \hat\beta_2 x_2 + \hat\beta_3 x_3$$
            $$\hat x_2 = \hat\gamma_0 + \hat\gamma_1 x_1 + \hat\gamma_3 x_3$$
            Then, the coefficient of \(x_1\) in the first regression will be the same as the coefficient of \(x_1\)
            in the second regression. This is because the coefficient of \(x_1\) in the first regression is the
            effect of \(x_1\) on \(y\), while keeping \(x_2\) and \(x_3\) constant. And the coefficient of \(x_1\)
            in the second regression is the effect of \(x_1\) on \(x_2\), while keeping \(x_3\) constant. So, the
            Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem says that the effect of \(x_1\) on \(y\), while keeping \(x_2\) and \(x_3\)
            constant, is the same as the effect of \(x_1\) on \(x_2\), while keeping \(x_3\) constant.
        </p>

        <h2>Going further</h2><hr>
        <p>
            In this post, we saw that the "all other things being equal" expression is used to say that you are
            looking at the effect of one variable on another, while keeping all other variables constant. We also
            saw that this expression has an impact on the interpretation of the coefficients. Finally, we saw that
            the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem is a theorem that allows you to get the same results as if you had
            run a regression with all the variables, while only running a regression with one variable.
