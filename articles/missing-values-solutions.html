        <h1>Missing values: how to go beyond the mean and the mode?</h2><hr>
        <p>
            Missing values (NA or NaN) is one of the most common problems in data science. NA values can be
            problematic because they can lead to biased results. For example, if you want to know the average
            revenue of a population, and you have missing values, you might have problems such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Maybe rich people are more likely to not answer the question</li>
                <li>Maybe poor people are more likely to not answer the question</li>
                <li>Maybe people who are not rich nor poor are more likely to not answer the question</li>
                <li>Maybe NA values are randomly distributed</li>
            </ul>
            In this post, we will go over the following points:
            <ul>
                <li>Why not keeping the NA?</li>
                <li>What are the different types of missing values?</li>
                <li>Easy and better solutions than the mean and the mode</li>
                <li>Complex solutions</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Why not keeping the NA?</h2><hr>
        <p>
            A naive solution to the problem of missing values is to just keep the NA values.
            Even tough NA generally cause problems when doing statistical analysis, there are tools
            that allow you to keep the NA values. For example, you can use a <a
            href='https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#histogram-based-gradient-boosting'
            target="_blank"> histogram-based gradient boosting</a> model that can handle NA values. These models can work
            either with numerical or categorical variables. However, this solution is not always the best
            and does not allows you to explore as much as you would like your data.

        <h2>Different types of missing values</h2><hr>
        <p>
            There are different types of missing values:
            <ul>
                <li>MCAR: Missing Completely At Random. This concerns NA whose absence is determined purely
                    at random and does not depend on the individuals. This is a rather rare situation.</li>
                <li>MAR: Missing At Random. The probability of being missing is the same only within groups
                    defined by the observed data. The missingness is related to the observed data but not
                    the unobserved data.</li>
                <li>MNAR: Missing Not At Random. The probability of being missing varies for reasons that are 
                    unknown to the researcher and related to the missing data itself.</li>
                <li>Structurally missing. Missingness that occurs due to the structure of the data. For
                    example, in a survey, a question about pregnancy might only be presented to female
                    respondents, so male respondents would have structurally missing values for this item.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Why does it matter? Because the way you deal with NA depends on the type of missing
            values. For example, if you have MCAR and a high enough sample size, you can just drop the rows
            with NA. If you have MNAR, your estimations will be biased if you do not take into
            account the NA.
        </p>

        <h2>Going further</h2><hr>
        <p>
            In this post, we saw that the "all other things being equal" expression is used to say that you are
            looking at the effect of one variable on another, while keeping all other variables constant. We also
            saw that this expression has an impact on the interpretation of the coefficients. Finally, we saw that
            the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell theorem is a theorem that allows you to get the same results as if you had
            run a regression with all the variables, while only running a regression with one variable.
