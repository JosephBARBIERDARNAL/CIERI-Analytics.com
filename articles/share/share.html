        <h2>About the SHARE Survey</h2><hr>
        <p>The <a href='https://share-eric.eu' target="_blank">Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE)</a>
            is a comprehensive research infrastructure dedicated to the
            study of the impacts of health, social, economic, and environmental
            policies across the lifespans of European citizens. SHARE's scope
            extends beyond Europe, contributing to a broader understanding of
            these critical issues. The project boasts an impressive accumulation
            of 3,962 publications and over 24 years of experience. It has conducted
            530,000 interviews, engaging with 140,000 respondents across 28 countries.
        </p>
        <p>We are currently working on various analysis of the available data and
            we will share our results on this website. Our goal is to provide insights
            on identity and behavior, using data science and statistics.
        </p>

        <h2>Country prediction</h2><hr>
        <p>One of the first analysis we did was to predict the country of origin of the respondents
            based on their answers to the survey. This is currently a work in progress.
