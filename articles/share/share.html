        <h1>SHARE: the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe</h1><hr>
        <p>SHARE, the largest European study in social sciences, contains a lot of
            un-exploited datasets. Moreover, most work on SHARE focus on low complexity
            and easy-to-interpet modelling tools, which might masks some important effects.
        </p>
        <p>Our work consist of investigating the explanability aspect of some important 
            health variables: cancer, mental health and identity in general.

        <h2>About the SHARE Survey</h2><hr>
        <p>The <a href='https://share-eric.eu' target="_blank">Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE)</a>
            is a comprehensive research infrastructure dedicated to the
            study of the impacts of health, social, economic, and environmental
            policies across the lifespans of European citizens. SHARE's scope
            extends beyond Europe, contributing to a broader understanding of
            these critical issues. The project boasts an impressive accumulation
            of 3,962 publications and over 24 years of experience. It has conducted
            530,000 interviews, engaging with 140,000 respondents across 28 countries.
        </p>
        <p>We are currently working on various analysis of the available data and
            we will share our results on this website. Our goal is to provide insights
            on identity and behavior, using data science and statistics.
