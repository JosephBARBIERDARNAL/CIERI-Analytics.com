        <h1>Working with SHARE: a tutorial in R and Python</h2><hr>
        <p>Dealing with SHARE data can be tricky for non-initiated since most datasets
            contain lots of columns with very specific name, there are a lot of missing values
            and outliers, as well as lots of other complexity!
        </p>
        <p>However, main data analysis software, Python and R, can easily deal with most of those problems.
            In this post, we'll go over how to open datasets, merge them, clean the variables, and other
            aspects that will make your dataset ready for your analysis.
        </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Warning: we work with Stata format (.dta) but it's the exactly the same
            for SPSS! Just change the file extension.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Before starting</h2><hr>
        <p>
            There is nothing worse than a bad working environment. Before starting, make sure
            you have a created a new folder for your project. Let's call it the share-project".
            In this "share-project" folder, you will have a "data" folder where you will put all
            the datasets you will need. If you don't know exactly which datasets you need, you can
            find info on the <a href="https://share-eric.eu/" target="_blank">SHARE website</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that you have your folder, you need to have installed a few packages. If you never
            install them before, you can do it with the following commands:
        </p>

        <div class="code-container">
            <button class="lang-btn" id="button1" onclick="toggleCode('rCode1', 'pythonCode1', 'button1')">R</button>
            
            <pre id="rCode1"><code>
install.packages('dplyr')
install.packages('foreign')
            </code></pre>
            
            <pre id="pythonCode1" style="display: none;"><code>
pip install pandas
            </code></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
            Now that you have your folder and your packages, you are ready to start!
            Load the packages in your environment and let's go!
        </p>
        <p style="font-style: italic;">Make sure you're working directory is the "share-project" folder.</p>

        <div class="code-container">
            <button class="lang-btn" id="button2" onclick="toggleCode('rCode2', 'pythonCode2', 'button2')">R</button>
            
            <pre id="rCode2"><code>
library(dplyr)
library(foreign)
            </code></pre>
            
            <pre id="pythonCode2" style="display: none;"><code>
import pandas as pd

        <h2>Opening Datasets</h2><hr>
        <p>
            First step is to open the datasets. In most case, you will need to open multiple
            datasets and merge them together.
        </p>
        <p>
            Datasets have the following format: <i>"sharew6_rel8-0-0_br.dta"</i>. For example, this dataset
            is the 8th release, of the 6th wave for the "br" data of the SHARE dataset. The "br"
            is for "Behavior Risks". In general, try to have the latest release available.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to know which dataset you need, I recommend you to go to the
            <a href="https://share-eric.eu/" target="_blank">SHARE website</a>. There, you can find
            the documentation for each wave and questionnaires.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now let's see an example of to open 3 datasets in a proper way with the indication
            from before.
        </p>

        <div class="code-container">
            <button class="lang-btn" id="button3" onclick="toggleCode('rCode3', 'pythonCode3', 'button3')">R</button>
            
            <pre id="rCode3"><code>
br_dataframe = read_dta('data/sharew6_rel8-0-0_br.dta')
dn_dataframe = read_dta('data/sharew8_rel8-0-0_dn.dta')
ph_dataframe = read_dta('data/sharew8_rel8-0-0_ph.dta')
            </code></pre>
            
            <pre id="pythonCode3" style="display: none;"><code>
br_dataframe = pd.read_stata('data/sharew6_rel8-0-0_br.dta')
dn_dataframe = pd.read_stata('data/sharew8_rel8-0-0_dn.dta')
ph_dataframe = pd.read_stata('data/sharew8_rel8-0-0_ph.dta')
            </code></pre>
        </div>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Merging Datasets</h2><hr>
        <p>
            Now that we have our datasets, we need to merge them together. Merging datasets
            is a very important step since it will allow us to have a complete dataset with
            all the variables we need. In our case, we want to merge the "br", "dn" and "ph"
            datasets together.
        </p>    
        <p>In order to do so, we need to find a common variable between the datasets. In our case,
            we will use the <i>"mergeid"</i> variable which is the unique identifier for each respondent.
            When working with this type of database, it's pretty common to have a unique identifier such
            as <i>"mergeid"</i> or <i>"id"</i>. 
        </p>

        <div class="code-container">
            <button class="lang-btn" id="button4" onclick="toggleCode('rCode4', 'pythonCode4', 'button4')">R</button>
            
            <pre id="rCode4"><code>
merged_dataframe = merge(br_dataframe, dn_dataframe, by = 'mergeid') 
merged_dataframe = merge(merged_dataframe, ph_dataframe, by = 'mergeid')
            </code></pre>
            
            <pre id="pythonCode4" style="display: none;"><code>
merged_dataframe = pd.merge(br_dataframe, dn_dataframe, on = 'mergeid')
merged_dataframe = pd.merge(merged_dataframe, ph_dataframe, on = 'mergeid')
            </code></pre>
        </div>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Removing Variables</h2><hr>
        <p>
            Now that we have our merged dataset, we need to remove the variables we don't need.
            In our case, we don't need all the variables from the "br", "dn" and "ph" datasets.
            We only need a few of them. So let's remove the variables we don't need!
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's say we want to keep the following variable:
            <ul>
                <li>Marital Status: <b>dn014_</b></li>
                <li>Gender: <b>dn042_</b></li>
                <li>Year of Birth: <b>dn003_</b></li>
                <li>Smoking: <b>br002_</b></li>
                <li>Sport Frequency: <b>br015_</b></li>
                <li>Health self-perception: <b>ph003_</b></li>
                <li>Pain: <b>ph084_</b></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's see how to just keep those variables. We'll call our new dataset <i>"df"</i>
            in order to keep in memory the first merged dataset. Moreover, it makes the code
            easier to read.
        </p>

        <div class="code-container">
            <button class="lang-btn" id="button5" onclick="toggleCode('rCode5', 'pythonCode5', 'button5')">R</button>
            
            <pre id="rCode5"><code>
df = merged_dataframe %>%
        select(contains('dn014_'), contains('dn042_'),
               contains('br002_'), contains('br015_'),
               contains('ph003_'), contains('ph084_'),
               contains('dn003_'))
            </code></pre>

            <pre id="pythonCode5" style="display: none;"><code>
df = merged_dataframe[['dn014_', 'dn042_',
                       'br002_', 'br015_',
                       'ph003_', 'ph084_',
                       'dn003_']]
            </code></pre>
        </div>

        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Renaming Variables</h2><hr>
        <p>
            Now that we have our merged dataset with only the right variables, we need to rename them. The main reason
            is that the variables names are not very explicit. For example, the variable <i>"dn014_"</i>
            is the variable for the respondent's marital status. It's not very explicit and it's not very easy
            to remember. So let's rename it!
        </p>
        <p>
            Renaming variables is not necessary in itself but it can be considered as a <b>good practice</b>
            since it makes your work clearer and easier to understand, for you or your reviewers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, even if you work with lots of variables, take the time to rename them. It will save you
            a lot of time in the future (and you'll see that you will just need to run it just once thanks to a <b>trick</b>!)
        </p>

            <button class="lang-btn" id="button6" onclick="toggleCode('rCode6', 'pythonCode6', 'button6')">R</button>
            
            <pre id="rCode6"><code>

        rename(
          MaritalStatus = dn014_,
          Gender = dn042_,

          Smoking = br002_,
          SportFrequency = br015_,
          HealthSelfPerception = ph003_,
          Pain = ph084_
        )

        <h2>Missing values</h2><hr>
        <p>
            In SHARE, there are different formats for missing values. For example, there are some
            <i>"real"</i> missing values where the corresponding value is empty. But there are also
            some <i>"fake"</i> missing values. Let's see this in more details.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to SHARE's documentation, there are missing codes that defines the type of missing
            value:
            <ul>
                <li>-1: "Don't know"</li>
                <li>-2: "Refusal"</li>
                <li>-3: "Implausible value/suspected wrong"</li>
                <li>-4: "Not codable"</li>
                <li>-5: "Not answered"</li>
                <li>-7: "Not yet coded"</li>
                <li>-9: "Not applicable"</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            For financial variables, there are also some specific missing codes:
            <ul>
                <li>-9999991: "Don't know"</li>
                <li>-9999992: "Refusal"</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            For not applicable variables (-9), there are also some specific missing codes in the
            case you need to know why the variable is not applicable:
            <ul>
                <li>-91: "Not applicable (not yet part of sample)"</li>
                <li>-92: "Not applicable (no participation in this wave)"</li>
                <li>-93: "Not applicable (respondent was not listed as household member in this wave)"</li>
                <li>-94: "Not applicable (respondent has an End-of-Life interview in previous waves)"</li>
                <li>-95: "Not applicable (no main interview done)"</li>
                <li> -98: "Not applicable (other reason)"</li>
                <li> -99: "Not applicable (missing by design)"</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            For some reasons, you can find sometimes in the dataset the actual descriptions of the missing
            codes. For example, you can find <i>"Don't know"</i> instead of <i>-1</i>. This means that you
            need to check in which format the missing codes are. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this post we will assume that your work is not based on missing values. This means
            that we will transform all the previous missing codes into <i>"real"</i> missing values.
            Concrete example: if a respondent has a missing value for the variable <i>"blabla"</i> because
            he/she refused to answer, we will transform the value into a <i>"real"</i> missing value, also
            called <i>NA, NaN or None</i> in R and Python.
        </p>

        <div class="code-container">
            <button class="lang-btn" id="button7" onclick="toggleCode('rCode7', 'pythonCode7', 'button7')">R</button>
            
            <!-- Iterates over all column and transform all missing codes to NA -->
            <pre id="rCode7"><code>
values_to_replace = c("Don't know", "Refusal",
                      "Implausible value/suspected wrong",
                      "Not codable", "Not answered",
                      "Not yet coded", "Not applicable")      
df = df %>%
  mutate(across(everything(),
         ~if_else(. %in% values_to_replace, NA, .)))
            </code></pre>
            
            <pre id="pythonCode7" style="display: none;"><code>
values_to_replace = ["Don't know", "Refusal",
                     "Implausible value/suspected wrong", 
                     "Not codable", "Not answered",
                     "Not yet coded", "Not applicable"]
df.replace(values_to_replace, float('NaN'), inplace=True)
            </code></pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            Now that we have transformed all the missing codes into <i>"real"</i> missing values, we have
            almost finished!
        </p>
        
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>Data types</h2><hr>
        <p>
            Now that we have our dataset with only the variables we need, we need to check the data types.
            The data types is what your computer will understand. For example, a number is not the same
            as a text. For a computer, 3 and "3" are not the same. The first one is a number and the second
            one is a text, and if you want the computer to understand that they are the same, you need to
            transform the text into a number (or the number into a text).
        </p>
        <p>
            More generally, it can be considered as a good practice to check the data types of your variables. It will
            allow you to avoid some errors in the future.
        </p>

            If the output of the previous code is not what you expected, you can change the data type of

        <h2>Last steps before workable dataset</h2><hr>
        <p>
            Now that we have our dataset with only the variables we need, we need to check a few
            things:
            <ul>
                <li>What to do with missing values?</li>
                <li>What to do with outliers?</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, there is no right answer to those questions. It depends on your research
            question and your dataset. Both missing values and outliers can be considered as a complex
            problem and there are lots of different ways to deal with them. In this post, we will
            not cover this topic since it's very context dependent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we're gonna save the dataset in a csv file. This will allow us to open it without
            having to run all the previous code. It's a good practice to save your dataset in a csv
            file since it will allow you to open it easily in the future.

            <pre id="rCode11"><code>
write.csv(df, 'data/share-cleaned-dataset.csv', row.names = FALSE)
            </code></pre>
            
            <pre id="pythonCode11" style="display: none;"><code>
df.to_csv('data/share-cleaned-dataset.csv', index=False)
            </code></pre>

        <p>
            In this post, we saw how to open datasets, merge them, clean the variables, and other
            aspects that will make your dataset ready for your analysis in the context of the SHARE
            survey. We also saw some good practices that will make your work easier and clearer.
