        <h1>Journal of SHARE</h1><hr>
        <p>
            This is the journal of our work/ideas/problems on the <a href='share.html'>SHARE survey</a> we've encountered and the
            solutions we've applied. The top of the page contains our most recent reflections, and the further down you go, the more
            you can see older comments.

            <ul>
                <li>Important refacto of the website for better scalability and code good practices.</li>
                <li>Write an article about <a href='how-to-work-with-share-python-r.html'>how to work with SHARE data in Python and R</a>.</li>
                <li>Improve global set up (git).</a></li>

            <b>Other:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>We both learned a lot about development, especially about git and html/css/js.</li>

            <b>About first steps:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Regarding machine learning, we've decided to work with small samples gradually to test the model. 
                    In other words, we will test the model in successive waves, handling between 3 to 5 files at a time.
                    We will also need to address the issue of missing values, which will be a significant task.
                
                    <br>To begin our project, we have decided to divide the tasks among ourselves. Here are the initial 
                    points for investigation:</br>
            
                    <br>1 - Identify the first documents to be used.
                    <br>2 - Write an article about machine learning algorithms, covering their advantages, disadvantages, 
                    application conditions, inputs, and outputs.
                    <br>3 - Research and write an article about dealing with missing values (NaN) in machine learning.
                    <br>4 - Find documentation and write an article about handling imbalanced data.
                    <br>5 - Investigate the computational power required to implement machine learning on big data.
                    </p></li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            <b>List of things done:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a <a href='https://github.com/Tomasito64/SHARE' target="_blank">dedicated repo</a> on Github</li>
                <li>Merge all raw data into one global csv per wave</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Problems encountered:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Problems with git, especially with the .gitignore file and tracked files (now solved).
                    The problem was that we did not want to push the data on github but for some reasons
                    we weren't able to remove them from git (even with a cleared cache)
                </li>
                <li>Determine how we are going to run machine learning algos on such a large volume of data</li>
                <li>How to work with so many missing values and outliers to process them automatically</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Other:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>To do: write a first article on how to work with SHARE data and publish it on this site</li>
            </ul>
